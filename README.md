Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is Driverpass owned by Liam. They wanted us to design a system for students to help them pass their driver's license test which would include driving training, online classes and quizzes. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I designed the system well to be a workable system to help the drivers.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could pick one part of my documents to revise it would be my UML charts. I do not know if I followed the exact guidelines for each type. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpretted the user's needs and implemented them into my system by identifying what the owner Liam wanted and adding those features. For example Liam wanted to be able to access some information offline and online and I implemented that into my design. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing so that the product is something that they would want. Afterall, this is a product for them and not for you. You have to cater to the market to make your product sellable. For example if your typical user does not have a stable internet connection it may be best to make things downloadable for offline use. If you typical user is not computer litterate you may want to lose some features in order to make the poduct more simple. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by having the customer in mind. I try to design a product they could easily use and access. In the future in order to analyze and design a system I liked the strategy of designing it small piece by piece and then piecing it together. I also liked the technique of making a chart for deadlines so that it could easily been seen where too much work was assigned or too little.
